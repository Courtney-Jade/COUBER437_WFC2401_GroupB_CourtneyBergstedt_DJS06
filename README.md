# JavaScript Array Methods Exercises
This project is designed to deepen your understanding of JavaScript's powerful array methods by challenging you to manipulate data using methods like forEach, map, filter, reduce, and more. The exercises will test your ability to apply these methods in combination to solve complex problems and achieve desired outcomes. The essence of using these higher-order functions is to encourage a declarative approach to programming, leading to more readable, concise, and often more maintainable code.

### Exercises
ForEach Basics: Utilize forEach to log each name and province to the console, and then log each name with a matching province.
Uppercase Transformation: Use map to create a new array of province names in all uppercase.
Name Lengths: Create a new array using map that contains the length of each name.
Sorting: Use sort to alphabetically sort the provinces.
Filtering Cape: Use filter to remove provinces containing "Cape" and log the count of remaining provinces.
Finding 'S': Create a boolean array using map and some to determine if a name contains the letter 'S'.
Creating Object Mapping: Use reduce to transform the names array into an object mapping names to their respective provinces.

### Advanced Exercises (Single console.log Execution)
Log Products: Iterate over the products array, logging each product name.
Filter by Name Length: Filter out products with names longer than 5 characters.
Price Manipulation: Filter out products without prices, convert string prices to numbers, and calculate the total price using reduce.
Concatenate Product Names: Use reduce to concatenate all product names into a single string.
Find Extremes in Prices: Identify the highest and lowest-priced items, returning a string formatted as "Highest: X. Lowest: Y."
Object Transformation: Using Object.entries and reduce, recreate the products object with keys 'name' and 'cost', maintaining their original values.
